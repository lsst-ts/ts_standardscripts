    """Discover all running CSCs and send them all to OFFLINE state.

    Notes
    -----

    This SAL Script works by getting a list of components from the IDL
    directory, then finds which components are running by listening in to
    heartbeats. For indexed components, the script will accumulate indices
    until it receives at least 3 heartbeats from 1 of the components. This
    gives enough time to find all running instances of a particular CSC.

    After discovering the runnings CSCs, and their indices, the Script attempts
    to send them all to OFFLINE. The user can control the order in which the
    shutdown happens by providing the names of the components to start with and
    to end with. In any case, the Script will always finish with the
    ScriptQueue and ignore Scripts. Users can also provide a list of CSCs to be
    ignored.

    In order to prevent accidental execution of this Script, users must provide
    two required configuration parameters; user and reason. This also helps
    keep track of who is executing the shutdown and why.
