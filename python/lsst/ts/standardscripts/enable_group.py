class EnableGroup(salobj.BaseScript, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """Base Script for enabling groups of CSCs.

    This base class is setup to operate with minimum configuration. By default
    it will try to access an attribute `self.config.ignore`, which is supposed
    to contain a list of CSCs from the group to be ignored in the process.
    The name of the CSC must match the name of the CSC in `group.components`,
    which is the name of the CSC in lowercase, replacing the ":" with "_" for
    indexed components. For example,

        * ATMCS -> atmcs
        * NewMTMount -> newmtmount
        * Hexapod:1 -> hexapod_1

    For instance, if one wants to ignore the MTDomeTrajectory and the Hexapod:1
    (Hexapod with index=1) components from the MTCS the ignore field would look
    like:

        ignore:
            - mtdometrajectory
            - hexapod_1

    Nevertheless, if the parent class does not provide an `ignore` property the
    class will skip it.

    In addition, when subclassing this base class, users can provide settings
    for the configurable CSCs in the group. The naming *must* also follow the
    same guidelines as for the ignore field, matching the value in
    `group.components`. Following the example above, to pass in the labels
    `special_configuration` and `lut_with_temperature` to configure the
    MTDomeTrajectory and Hexapod:1, respectively, one would do;

        mtdometrajectory: special_configuration
        hexapod_1: lut_with_temperature


    Parameters
    ----------
    index : `int`
        Index of Script SAL component.

    descr : `str`
        Short Script description.
