Update several unit tests to be compatible with the kafka version of salobj.
This should be a backward compatible change and should work with both DDS and kafka versions of salobj.

In ``base_script_test_case.py``, add compatibility with the kafka version of salobj.

In ``auxtel/prepare_for/onsky.py``, postpone creating ``ATMCS`` and ``LATISS`` classes to the configure method.
This is more inline with the most recent guidelines for script development and improve reliability for the kafka version of salobj.

Update ``.gitignore`` to ignore files from ruff and clang-format.

In ``tests/test_system_wide_shutdown.py``, make test resilient to changing order of the component index.

In ``system_wide_shutdown``:

    - Update to get list of components from ts-xml and to limit the number of components it checks at a single time.

    - Treat non-index component the same way indexed components are treated, e.g. wait for at least ``min_heartbeat`` heartbeat events before deming it alive.
